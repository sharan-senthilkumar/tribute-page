            <h4>V12 Toyota Supra</h4>
            <p>
                Considering Nagata started his career as a mechanic at Toyota, it is no surprise to know that one of his most memorable builds is a Toyota Supra. However, Smokey was also someone who knew the pros and cons of the Toyota Supra. So, he replaced the stock Supra engine and strapped a 5.0L V12 1GZ-FE engine from a Toyota Century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Top Secret A80 (fourth generation) V12 Supra featured custom forged rods and pistons, twin HKS GT2835 turbochargers, and HKS F-CON V Pro ECUs. Other updates include a custom aero kit, Roberuta Cup suspension system, and a six-speed manual transmission. This all helped the car generate around 930hp and go up to top speeds of 222mph, which was recorded at the Nardo Ring, Italy.

            <h4>Fusion RR Skyline R34</h4>
            <p>
                Smokey Nagata is probably one of the very few people who has worked on all generations of Nissan GT-R. His R33 going from 0-186mph in 17 seconds at Yatabe was the trigger that led to his A1(M) run. However, the Fusion RR Skyline R34 is probably an even better build that checks all the boxes. The base car for the Top Secret Fusion RR is a 2001 Nismo N1 Super Taikyu Skyline GT-R R34. The car is powered by an RB26DETT tuned by Top Secret and features a host of upgrades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the performance parts are either from Top Secret or HKS and return 900 hp. The Top Secret Fusion RR Skyline is also wrapped in gold, which is now a trademark for all Top Secret Smokey Nagata cars. The hood, trunk, spoiler, and front and rear diffuser are all made of carbon fiber. The Fusion RR Skyline R34 goes from 0-60mph in just 3.1 seconds and has a top speed of 198.4mph.

            <h4>Top Secret Supra</h4>
            <p>
                It is a common misinterpretation that the Top Secret Supra had a V12 engine, but that’s not the story.<span style="color:rgb(94, 221, 21); "> The car that Smokey Nagata drove along the A1(M) and got arrested was the Fusion R Supra, more popularly known as the Top Secret RB26 Supra. Yes, that’s right, Smokey Nagata engine swapped the stock Toyota engine with a Nissan RB26DETT as it offered more high-end power.</span> According to Nagata, the 2JZ engine was great for low-end torque, but what he needed was high-end power, and the GT-R RB26 engine was the perfect candidate.
            </p>
            <p>
                By mixing the refined and punchy RB26 engine with the aerodynamic body of Supra, Smokey Nagata created the perfect combination. He flew the car to the UK with the objective of hitting 200mph. However, the car running on lean fuel and the hood almost breaking apart at 190mph prevented him from achieving this. But the car still topped out at 197mph.

            <h4>Top Secret Silvia S15</h4>
            <p>
                The Top Secret Silvia S15 is not a street-legal car, as it was custom-built for the drifting championship (D1GP). However, the build is a perfect demonstration of how Smokey Nagata crafts JDM monsters from scratch. The Top Secret Silvia S15 build for drift champion Ryuji Miki came with the stock SR20DET engine. With Nagata’s craftmanship and expertise, the finished build was able to produce a whopping 534 hp.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you didn’t know already, the stock Silvia S15 SR20DET only produces around 250hp! The drift spec S15 also featured a custom Top Secret body kit, KW coil over suspension, and HKS F-CON V Pro ECU, among other upgrades. Smokey Nagata and his team used an HKS enlargement kit and Tomei camshaft to upgrade the stock engine. They also strapped an HKS turbocharger and a custom exhaust manifold to enhance power delivery.

            <h4>Skyline VR 32 GT-R</h4>
            <p>
                Top Secret VR 32 GT-R is probably the only Top Secret Smokey Nagata car that’s popular but doesn’t feature the trademark gold paint scheme. On the exterior, it looks more or less like a restored R32, which is one of the oldest generations of Skyline you can get these days. However, underneath the hood and inside the doors, you get an entirely different story! Pop the hood, and you will be shell-shocked to see the engine. Why? Because it is the VR38DETT engine, aka the R35 engine!
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, that’s right, Smokey Nagata went berzerk with his Skyline VR32 GT-R, and it does not end with the massive engine upgrade. In fact, Nagata has replaced every component that comes after the radiator support with that of a GT-R R35. On top of increasing the power to nearly 750hp, the Skyline VR 32 GT-R also has the transmission system and interior of the GT-R R35. On opening the door, you will also see that the Skyline R32 GT-R has been completely stripped off and replaced with the modern R35 GT-R.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Smokey Nagata cars are the pinnacle of engineering and performance tuning. All of the Top Secret works showcase that there is no limit to pushing the boundaries when you have the right hands. What started as a love for cars in a small Toyota shop now spreads across the world. The small-time car tuning shop in Chiba is now on the world map.</p>
        <p>From Mazda RX7 to Nissan Skyline and Toyota Supra, there are very few JDM cars that Smokey Nagata hasn’t operated on. Nagata’s heart surgery on the R32 BNR GT-R with the heart of the fastest GT-R, the R35, showcases his sheer brilliance. More than adding power, Nagata combined the lightweight chassis of the GT-R with the most powerful engine in the GT-R lineup! Top Secret cars might have started as a secret, but the performance and potential are definitely not a secret! </p>
